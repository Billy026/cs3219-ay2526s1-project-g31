# CS3219 Project (PeerPrep) - AY2526S1
## Group: G31

## Set up
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the environment variables as needed.
2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build` to start all services in development mode.

## Development
- For testing individual microservices, navigate to the respective microservice folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of that microservice.
- Hot reload is not supported when running with Docker. For hot reload during development, you can run the microservices individually as described in their respective `README.md` files.

### Note: 
- You are required to develop individual microservices within separate folders within this repository.
- The teaching team should be given access to the repositories as we may require viewing the history of the repository in case of any disputes or disagreements.
